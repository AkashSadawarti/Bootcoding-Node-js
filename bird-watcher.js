// You're an avid bird watcher that keeps track of how many birds have visited your garden in the last seven days.

// You have six tasks, all dealing with the numbers of birds that visited your garden.

// 1. Check what the counts were last week
// For comparison purposes, you always keep a copy of last week's counts nearby, which were: 0, 2, 5, 3, 7, 8 and 4. Implement the BirdWatcher.getLastWeek() method that returns last week's counts:
let birdsPerDay1 = [0,2,5,3,7,8,4]
function getLastWeek(){
       return birdsPerDay1;
}
console.log("---------Answer 1---------------")
console.log(getLastWeek())
// BirdWatcher.getLastWeek();
